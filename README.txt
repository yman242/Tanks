A little tank game made completely through code using OpenGL. It’s ugly because I made that tank with numbers! There’s a hill with people on it and they get shot. Basically shows off 3D programming with children to create things like the tank and some basic physics for the hill.

OpenGL Rocks tutorial code was used in some places, mainly in the rendering. It should be credited as such.
